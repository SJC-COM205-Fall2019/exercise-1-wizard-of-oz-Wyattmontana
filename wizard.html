<h2><strong>Chapter  3. How Dorothy Saved the Scarecrow</strong></h2>
<p>Then  she went back to the house, and having helped herself and Toto to a good drink  of the cool,<br />
  clear  water, she set about making ready for the journey to the City of Emeralds.<br />
  Dorothy  had only one other dress, but that happened to be clean and was hanging on a  peg beside<br />
  her  bed. It was gingham, with checks of white and blue; and although the blue was  somewhat<br />
  faded  with many washings, it was still a pretty frock. The girl washed herself  carefully, dressed<br />
  herself  in the clean gingham, and tied her pink sunbonnet on her head. She took a  little basket<br />
  and  filled it with bread from the cupboard, laying a white cloth over the top. Then  she looked<br />
  down  at her feet and noticed how old and worn her shoes were.<br />
  &quot;They  surely will never do for a long journey, Toto,&quot; she said. And Toto looked  up into her face<br />
  with  his little black eyes and wagged his tail to show he knew what she meant.<br />
  At  that moment Dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had belonged  to the Witch of<br />
the  East. &quot;I wonder if they will fit me,&quot; she said to Toto.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>&quot;They would be just the  thing to take a long walk in, for they could not wear out.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>She  took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones, which fitted her  as well as if they<br />
had  been made for her.<br />
  <br />
</p>
<h3><strong>Finally, she picked up her basket.</strong></h3>
<p>&rdquo;Come along,  Toto,&quot; she said. &quot;We will go to the Emerald City and ask the Great Oz  how to<br />
  get back to  Kansas again.&quot;<br />
  She closed the  door, locked it, and put the key carefully in the pocket of her dress. And so,<br />
  with Toto  trotting along soberly behind her, she started on her journey.<br />
  There were  several roads near by, but it did not take her long to find the one paved with<br />
  yellow bricks.  Within a short time she was walking briskly toward the Emerald City, her<br />
  silver shoes  tinkling merrily on the hard, yellow road-bed. The sun shone bright and the<br />
  birds sang  sweetly, and Dorothy did not feel nearly so bad as you might think a little  girl<br />
  would who had  been suddenly whisked away from her own country and set down in the<br />
midst of a  strange land.</p>
<h4><strong>She  was surprised</strong></h4>
<p>â€¦ as she  walked along, to see how pretty the country was about her. There were neat<br />
  fences at the  sides of the road, painted a dainty blue color, and beyond them were fields of<br />
  grain and  vegetables in abundance. Evidently the Munchkins were good farmers and able<br />
  to raise large  crops. Once in a while she would pass a house, and the people came out to<br />
  look at her  and bow low as she went by; for everyone knew she had been the means of<br />
  destroying the  Wicked Witch and setting them free from bondage. The houses of the<br />
  Munchkins were  odd-looking dwellings, for each was round, with a big dome for a roof. All<br />
  were painted  blue, for in this country of the East blue was the favorite color.<br />
  Toward  evening, when Dorothy was tired with her long walk and began to wonder where<br />
  she should  pass the night, she came to a house rather larger than the rest. On the green<br />
  lawn before it  many men and women were dancing. Five little fiddlers played as loudly as<br />
  possible, and  the people were laughing and singing, while a big table near by was loaded<br />
  with delicious  fruits and nuts, pies and cakes, and many other good things to eat.<br />
  The people  greeted Dorothy kindly, and invited her to supper and to pass the night with<br />
  them; for this  was the home of one of the richest Munchkins in the land, and his friends<br />
  were gathered  with him to celebrate their freedom from the bondage of the Wicked Witch.<br />
  Dorothy ate a  hearty supper and was waited upon by the rich Munchkin himself, whose<br />
  name was Boq.  Then she sat upon a settee and watched the people dance.<br />
When Boq saw her silver shoes he  said, &quot;You must be a great sorceress.&quot;</p>
